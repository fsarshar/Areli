# Unity ML-Agents Project

## Overview

This Unity project incorporates machine learning using the [ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). The project demonstrates the integration of a machine learning agent into a Unity environment for training and real-time control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Unity](https://unity.com/) installed on your machine.
- [ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) installed and configured.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-ml-agents-project.git
   ```

2. Open the Unity project in the Unity editor.

3. Follow the instructions in the ML-Agents Toolkit documentation to set up your environment and configure the project.

## Project Structure

- **Assets/:** Unity assets for the project.
- **Assets/MLAgents/:** ML-Agents specific scripts and configurations.
- **Scenes/:** Unity scene files.
- **Scripts/:** Your custom scripts for defining agent behavior and interactions.

## Training the Agent

1. Open the Unity editor and load the designated scene for training.

2. Configure the ML-Agents components attached to GameObjects in the scene.

3. Run the training process using the ML-Agents Toolkit. Refer to the ML-Agents documentation for detailed instructions.

## Using the Trained Model

1. Export the trained model from the ML-Agents Toolkit.

2. Integrate the trained model into your Unity project.

3. Test the ML agent in the Unity environment and observe its behavior.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project by creating issues or submitting pull requests.
